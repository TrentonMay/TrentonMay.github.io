            <h2>Trenton May</h2>
            <p>When I first started my college journey I started out at Full Sail Online in the MBPS course hoping to one day be a music producer. After almost 2 years in that course
            I decided that it wasn't the best Idea to go into the music industry due to the fact that it is incredibly difficult to get a job in that field without first having years
            of experience. While in the process of finding out what I wanted to do instead of music production a friend of mine had introduced me to coding and told me about the
            fruits of his labor as a freelancer and I was immediately hooked on the idea of being a web developer/designer. Upon this realization of what I want to do with my life
            I began the apparently long process of switching degrees at FSO. After being out of classes for 5 months while the transfer was taking place I was finally in the classes that
            I needed to be in to learn how to code and design. There are many challenges that I have faced at FSO and many more I will face in the future but with a little over a year of classes
            left I am feeling very optimistic that I will graduate and get my dream job.</p>

                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>With this element the target audience is people who are looking for antique items for a collection or whatever their purpose may be.
                    Specifically this element with the images that they used is going to target people looking for antique furniture, guns and clocks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>This element speaks to the client goals entirely because of its basic and simple construction which allows the user to clearly interpret what they
                    need to do to operate this feature. This is supported by the fact that it is clear what each section leads to and it conveys what the user needs to click
                    to get to browse the specific items. So if a user wanted to look at antique clocks they can very clearly see what they need to click to browse that topic, which would
                    be the antique clocks square. Additionally there are features in place that tell the user this is a clickable element that allows them to search. What I'm talking about is the
                    green arrow that points to the right. This is powerful reinforcement needed to help users of all skill levels make the concious decision to click on this element to
                    navigate where they need to go</p>

                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p>Looking at the design critique I do not completely agree with how it it is featured. First of all I think that just 3 elements is not enough for a page
                    to give a user all of the options that they want to have to search for. Creating only 3 areas for you to search for something ends up requiring them to be displayed
                    larger than what they would be if there were more options which makes them unnecessarily bulky on the page. When it comes to the color I do like the scheme but I feel as if the
                    particular green doesn't portray the mood correctly. The green that is used has a mood that is described as "Guady, Trendy, Tacky, and Sickening." These adjectives do not really
                    portray what this design needs. Possibly "tacky" may work for this design since it is antiques but the overall mood doesn't feel right and I believe that the designer was
                    just looking for well contrasting colors, which he did do right (applause to the designer). A better color to choose for the button would be "Teal Blue", "Silver", or "Tuape" because
                    all three of these colors portray a feeling of "Classic" or "Classy" which suits this perfectly.</p>

                <li>
                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>For this composition I can see that the desired audience is for a younger people in their 20's who love smooth elegant design that truly captures the
                    eye. It is also for that user that loves to see progress (due to the percentage bars) or even a person involved with business. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>This composition appeals to the client goals because it promotes a professional look and environment for their business. Having a professional look is a big
                    part of having a website due to the fact that if you do not have a professional looking website users will often not think that the business is trustworthy. As for
                    the user needs this element doesn't have and real functionality that the user can interact with but they can clearly see that there is some sort of progress happening
                    of some sort happening which is the main use of this feature. Overall this design appeals to the user and client needs completely.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p>When it comes down to it I love this design and I feel like it can be implemented in many ways not just as a welcome message (I'm not too sure why a welcome
                    area would even need a loading bar though) but, I digress. What I love about this design is the simple construction that it takes on, just like they always say
                    on design websites, "KISS", Keep It Simple Stupid! Aside from the overall structure and the simplicity of the elements I think that the color scheme is very well
                    thought out. It makes use of a certain blue that conveys feelings of peacefulness and quiet which is what you want when you are being welcomed to a page. The welcome
                    is never extreme or in your face it's always easing and reassuring that you are in a great place. One pain point that I do have is that the text under the "Welcome" is way
                    too small and will be hard to read for those that have bad vision. Of course the user can always go into their browser settings and change how big the text is displayed
                    on the screen but I think the point of a website is for it to be usable and to not have to make the user do any extra work just to be able to use the product</p>

                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>The target audience for this composition would be people looking for what to eat for their next meal. This composition would allow people to clearly
                    see what is possible to eat from just about every single food group. It also appeals to anyone who loves to get tasks done in a timely fashion
                    due to the organization of these items. Lastly it more than likely appeals to those who are younger (in their 20s and lower 30s) because most older users
                    would more than likely just go to the store or google recipes if they are familiar with the internet</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>In this composition we can clearly see that it appeals to the clients needs due to the fact that it is going to allow their users to search quickly and
                    precisely for what they want to view which will help with the clients sales. This is helped by the fact that the organization of elements is helpful to allow users to see exactly what they need to
                    click on to go to where they need to be. When it comes to a businesses website, it is imperative that the elements on the page are usable and that the ui is
                        appealing to the eye. This composition appeals to that big rule that everything must be usable due to its great UI.
                        The user needs are met in that they can get a clear and concise idea of what they will view on the next page when it loads which is what a client needs to
                    happen in order to get sales</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p>I for one love this design aside from a few critiques that I have for the UI. One of these critiques is the placement of the search button which covers
                    up some of the photo that visually shows what the user will end up going to. This critique of course can be completely unnecessary if the designer meant for the
                    search icon to only show when the element is hovered upon, but for what is shown I think the search icon shouldn't be where it is. As for the color scheme I think that
                    if the designer is going to use different colors he should use colors that convey the general colors of each food group. A good example of this would be that for fish use
                    blue, for red meat use red, for vegetables use green, bread use brown, grocery/frozen use blue or silver, and the drinks are okay the way that they are. Overall the
                    colors contrast well except for the white letters on the yellow background on the vegetables. The structure of the design is great in that it enables them to have
                    enough options for a user to make a clear choice but it does not crowd the page with too many elements to confuse the user. </p>

                    <p>The client needs are met in this composition due to the fact that this is element has great usability and looks great. It allows the user to clearly see
                    who is working at this business and the design makes the business look very trustworthy which as I have said before is an important aspect of business. As for the user
                    needs this design allows the user to really get to know these individuals due to the use of the social media buttons at the bottom of each photo. The user also very
                    clearly knows what they need to do on this item because the design is very simple.</p>

                <li>
                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p>First of all I want to say that I absolutely love this design. It's probably my favorite on this entire page due to the fact that it is extremely professional
                    and well thought out. Everything is so smooth and the transparent background really helps with the overall look of the composition. One critique that I have is that it
                    does look as if there is a white border on each of the images which makes it feel a little constricting even though that the design obviously portrays a feeling of
                    calmness, peacefulness, clarity, and trustworthiness. Even though the borders are very minute, I think that if they were gone it would help push the design to be
                    a little more great. My final critique for this is that the text below the names are just a little too small or the typeface should be different so that
                    the user may be able to read it a little better.</p>

                    <p>The target audience for this composition would be users who want to view a gallery of photos. It's also for user who love to not have to load on to another page
                    to view a gallery of photos. They can make use of certain programming benefits that allow you to stay on the same page whilst interacting with it</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>The client goals are met in this composition due to the fact that they can show a full gallery of photos that doesn't make you load an entire new page to view.
                    It also has a great design structure that allows its users to navigate through the photos without having to learn the interface because it makes use of
                    certain design principles that are used on other websites which allows most users to immediately identify how to operate elements. This all helps keep the users
                        from getting frustrated and it helps the business make money which makes them very happy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p>This design is great but it isn't the best that it could be. First of all I feel as if the slider buttons could be slightly bigger to help the user
                    along the process of actually finding the buttons to operate this items functionality. Although, if the buttons were too big it would really off-put the
                    great look of this composition. Whilst I'm talking about making things bigger to be more usable I believe the "more" button could get a little bigger without
                    taking away from the great look of this and it will help the user find the button easier. As I've said before it's a great idea to think about older or visually
                    impaired users who don't have the vision of an eagle. When it comes to the color scheme I agree with the colors that the designer implemented. The colors convey a
                    feeling of wholesomeness, country, warmth, and welcoming. I believe this accurately conveys the feeling that the business would like to put out and the
                    designer implemented this in a great way because he used actual pictures of bakery food for the background while still sticking to the mood that the business wanted
                    to show.</p>

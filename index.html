            <h2>Trenton May</h2>
            <p>When I first started my college journey I started out at Full Sail Online in the MBPS course hoping to one day be a music producer. After almost 2 years in that course
            I decided that it wasn't the best Idea to go into the music industry due to the fact that it is incredibly difficult to get a job in that field without first having years
            of experience. While in the process of finding out what I wanted to do instead of music production a friend of mine had introduced me to coding and told me about the
            fruits of his labor as a freelancer and I was immediately hooked on the idea of being a web developer/designer. Upon this realization of what I want to do with my life
            I began the apparently long process of switching degrees at FSO. After being out of classes for 5 months while the transfer was taking place I was finally in the classes that
            I needed to be in to learn how to code and design. There are many challenges that I have faced at FSO and many more I will face in the future but with a little over a year of classes
            left I am feeling very optimistic that I will graduate and get my dream job.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>With this element the target audience is people who are looking for antique items for a collection or whatever their purpose may be.
                    Specifically this element with the images that they used is going to target people looking for antique furniture, guns and clocks. The age group
                    that this would speak to is people who are 35+ years old considering that the majority of younger people aren't very interested in antiques</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>This element speaks to the client goals entirely because of its basic and simple construction which allows the user to clearly interpret what they
                    need to do to operate this feature. This is supported by the fact that it is clear what each section leads to and it conveys what the user needs to click
                    to get to browse the specific items. So if a user wanted to look at antique clocks they can very clearly see what they need to click to browse that topic, which would
                    be the antique clocks square. Additionally there are features in place that tell the user this is a clickable element that allows them to search. What I'm talking about is the
                    green arrow that points to the right. This is powerful reinforcement needed to help users of all skill levels make the conscious decision to click on this element to
                    navigate where they need to go. This in turn allows the client to generate good customer service and may potentially lead to profits because the user will be able to
                    find what they want to buy. This can speak to existing customers/users or even new ones who are just looking for a good antique find.</p>

                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p>When it comes to this composition I do really enjoy the design of it all aside from a grievance or two I think that this is a solid piece of work. Starting with the
                        color I do think that the scheme works and it is a good direction to go in. The colors contrast well and it does give you that antique old and classy feel. As for the
                        placement of the elements the designer did a great job at incorporating the users needs into the design. First of all the green button with the white arrow will make the user
                        feel safe in their decision that this is in fact the correct place to click to go to where they need to go.

            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <a href="http://scr.templatemonster.com/55200/55201-big.jpg"><img src="images/comp-2.jpg"></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>For this composition I can see that the desired audience is for a person involved with business most likely in their upper 20's and 30's and so forth. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>This composition appeals to the client goals because it promotes a professional look and environment for their business. Having a professional look is a big
                    part of having a website due to the fact that if you do not have a professional looking website users will often not think that the business is trustworthy. As for
                    the user needs this element doesn't have any real functionality that the user can interact with but they can clearly see that there is some sort of progress happening
                    of some sort happening which is the main use of this feature. Overall this design appeals to the user and client needs completely. This composition may potentially speak to the
                    returning user more than the new user who has just stumbled upon this site. But, this element can and does provide valuable information that the users whether new or
                    returning may take interest in.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p>When it comes down to it I love this design and I feel like it can be implemented in many ways not just as a welcome message. What I love about this design is the simple
                        construction that it takes on, just like they always say
                    on design websites, "KISS", Keep It Simple Stupid! Aside from the overall structure and the simplicity of the elements I think that the color scheme is very well
                    thought out. It makes use of a certain blue that conveys feelings of peacefulness and quiet which is what you want when you are being welcomed to a page. The welcome
                    is never extreme or in your face it's always easing and reassuring that you are in a great place. </p>

            <h1>Multiple Items</h1>
            <a href="http://scr.templatemonster.com/55200/55204-big.jpg"><img src="images/comp-3.jpg"></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>The target audience for this composition would be people looking for what to eat for their next meal. This composition would allow people to clearly
                    see what is possible to eat from just about every single food group. It also appeals to anyone who loves to get tasks done in a timely fashion
                    due to the organization of these items. Lastly it more than likely appeals to those who are younger (in their 20s and lower 30s) because most older users
                    would more than likely just go to the store or google recipes if they are familiar with the internet and it may appeal to all genders because let's face it,
                    everyone loves food. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>In this composition we can clearly see that it appeals to the clients needs due to the fact that it is going to allow their users to search quickly and
                    precisely for what they want to view which will help with the clients sales. This is helped by the fact that the organization of elements is helpful to allow users to see exactly what they need to
                    click on to go to where they need to be. When it comes to a businesses website, it is imperative that the elements on the page are usable and that the ui is
                        appealing to the eye. This composition appeals to that big rule that everything must be usable due to its great UI.
                        The user needs are met in that they can get a clear and concise idea of what they will view on the next page when it loads which is what a client needs to
                    happen in order to get sales. Whether it's a new or frequent visitor this design and feature can grab the attention of any user which is good for the client and may
                    potentially generate profit.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p>I for one love this design aside from a few critiques that I have for the UI. One of these critiques is the placement of the search button which covers
                    up some of the photo that visually shows what the user will end up going to. This critique of course can be completely unnecessary if the designer meant for the
                    search icon to only show when the element is hovered upon, but for what is shown but the icon can be a good way to move the user in the right direction. As for the color
                    scheme the designer did a great job at making this design pop out at you. The mixture of these colors give this element a great mood and really bring out the photos which
                    can even help the user identify what they are looking for even faster.</p>

                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>The target audience is just about all ages and all types of people due to this compositions awesome sleek design that just about anyone can enjoy. It also may appeal
                    to homeowners and renters considering that this is a lawncare website. As for an outreach to a specific gender, this website has none because anyone can own a house (as
                    long as you are of age). </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>The client needs are met in this composition due to the fact that this is element has great usability and looks great. It allows the user to clearly see
                    who is working at this business and the design makes the business look very trustworthy which as I have said before is an important aspect of business. As for the user
                    needs this design allows the user to really get to know these individuals due to the use of the social media buttons at the bottom of each photo. The user also very
                    clearly knows what they need to do on this item because the design is very simple. Lastly, in this design it isn't so much about profit and making money it is more about
                    allowing the user to complete a task of which is getting to know this business on a personal level. This could potentially help later when the user makes the decision to
                    put their money into this lawn care company</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p>First of all I want to say that I absolutely love this design. It's probably my favorite on this entire page due to the fact that it is extremely professional
                    and well thought out. Everything is so smooth and the transparent background really helps with the overall look of the composition. The colors truly mix well together on this
                        to produce the moods of calmness, peacefulness, clarity, and trustworthiness which are great emotions to make your user feel when you're trying to showcase your team.
                        The designer definitely had the user and client in mind when he or she designed this great piece of art considering the well thought out placement and size of the elements.
                    Everything matches and lines up great. The buttons are the same size as the photo and the size of the text is perfect allowing the user to clearly see who these people are
                    and what they do at this company.</p>

            <h1>Gallery</h1>
            <a href="http://scr.templatemonster.com/54000/54000-big.jpg"><img src="images/comp-5.jpg"></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>The target audience for this composition would be users who love baking and want to see a gallery of photos that has to do with that very subject.
                        It's also mostly for people who are in their 20's and older considering that the majority of people that love the bake live on their own, are married,
                    have kids or just simply love to cook.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>The client goals are met in this composition due to the fact that they can show a full gallery of photos that doesn't make you load an entire new page to view.
                    It also has a great design structure that allows its users to navigate through the photos without having to learn the interface because it makes use of
                    certain design principles that are used on other websites which allows most users to immediately identify how to operate elements. This all helps keep the users
                        from getting frustrated and it helps the business make money which makes them very happy. The gallery alone may not exactly generate the company revenue,
                    but it does allow the users to complete a certain task that they may have interest in with ease. Often times a user wants to know the quality of what they are buying
                    before they buy it, this element helps the customer in that regard because it showcases multiple detailed photos of what the product may look like.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p>This design is great and meets the users needs very well. The slider buttons are an acceptable size which allows the user to clearly identify and see where they
                        need to click to go to the next photo in the slide. Also the white border on the image was a great idea implemented by the designer because of the background image behind
                        the main image that the user is viewing. The reason why I say this is because of contrast. If the white border wasn't there then the user would have a hard time
                        finding the difference between the foreground image and the background image. The white border separates these elements from each other and allows the foreground image
                        to stand out. When it comes to the color scheme I agree with the colors that the designer implemented. The colors convey a feeling of wholesomeness, country, warmth,
                        and welcoming. I believe this accurately conveys the feeling that the business would like to put out and the designer implemented this in a great way because he used
                        actual pictures of bakery food for the background while still sticking to the mood that the business wanted to show.</p>

                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p> This element appeals to simplicity and basic
                        function that works and gets tasks done which is why it will be so likable by people who want to get tasks done in a timely fashion. The age group that
                    this would appeal to would pretty much be people in their upper 20's and 30's and are business owners considering this is a financial advisory website.</p>

                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>The client goals are met in this navigation bar in that it allows them and their users to browse through different parts of the website with ease.
                        This composition does not clutter the page and it is very usable which is imperative to the users needs also. Sometimes the navigation is overlooked
                        on websites to focus more on the content of the page but here we can see that there was a good amount of attention paid to this nav to make sure that
                        the users are given a usable and great design interface to work with. The client needs are also met in that it very clearly showcases their logo in a
                        fashionable way that clearly shows the user where they are at. Brand recognition is important when it comes to a nav bar because often times depending
                        on the rest of the body the user will look at the top page and begin looking down. If the logo is at the top in the nav and is clearly being represented
                        then that helps the user to identify that they are in the right place.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p>This design is great due to the use of simplicity in its structure. This helps users move in the right direction when navigating through the page.
                        We all know those terrible nav bars all too well that have too many options and we become confused as to what we need to click on to go where we need
                        to go and this is why the simple design is great here. As for the colors that are used I love the pallets here in the logo and the underline color upon
                        hovering the links. The light blue portrays the correct feelings in this navbar considering this color symbolizes cool, trusting, contentment and calmness.
                        As for the logo it has a great gradient between light blue and a pinkish color which contrast very well and are appealing to the eye. </p>

                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>The target audience for this component could be for users who want a life coach and are more than likely in their 20's due to the fact that most people in their upper
                    30's and 40's already have their life together.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>It is pretty clear that the client needs here are met pretty well in that this component shows their top stories or just items general in a hierarchy of
                        importance. Just about anyone can look at this and see that the largest image in this is the top story or item in this list of items. The other four are
                        important also but not as important as the largest. The users needs are met due to the structure of the design and how the elements are positioned which allows
                        the user to clearly see what is the most important element. When you see a news story on a news website usually the main story is the first and largest item
                        on the page. A good example of this would be the Huffington post app for mobile devices which showcases the most important story at the top of the page and
                        it takes up the entire width of the screen. The same design principles are applied here and it appeals to the user needs allowing them to make quick and concise
                        decisions because they can immediately recognize the layout. This composition is all about a user task and it does a great job at pushing them in the right direction.
                    If a user is able to find what they need then the company may then collect revenue from ads and whatever else may be on the article page.</p>

                    <p>This design just has that nice smooth feeling to it that makes it fun to be on a website because it doesn't look grimy or unprofessional. As I've said before
                        the structure and layout of the elements is practically impeccable. This structure allows for the user to easily distinguish between what the primary story is
                        and what is the secondary story. What makes this desin great is that it is build from the ground up to appeal to the user and
                    allow them to find what they are looking for with ease. One thing that can speak for this is the fact that the designer added a certain degree of an transparent
                    overlay of gray onto each of the four elements on the right. What this does is that it allows the red in the button to stand out and say "Hey!! Click me!!" which helps
                    move the users in the right direction. It also allows for the title of each of the items to stand out and be more visible despite the colors of the actual photos in the
                    background of each of the items. </p>

                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>The target audience for this composition is people who own a business or are involved with business and need a financial advisor. The age group for this would probably
                    be someone who is in their upper 20's and above.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>This composition meets the client goals if they were asking for a simple and usable footer with social plug ins. Now, if they actually wanted navigation
                        in their footer then this would not meet the client goals, but let's just say they wanted this. This footer allows their users to share their page and
                        company all over the web which as we all know exposure is what a business loves whether they're just starting up or they're a prime corporation. This
                        composition also meets the user needs because it gives them a very clean, uncluttered, professional look at this company. Although, while as this footer
                        might meet some clients needs it may not meet other clients needs due to the fact that it is common practice for a web page to have multiple links in the
                        footer that aren't anywhere else in the page such as a careers, contact us, and support links. Depending on what page this is implemented on it could very
                        well meet the users expectations. But hey, who doesn't love to share interesting things they find on the internet. For those users, this footer works and meets
                        their needs. In the end this composition will give the client more exposure for hardly any effort at all and will later turn a profit for the company.</p>

                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p>Honestly there isn't much to critique about this composition. The styling is very simple but it works. The colors contrast very well (I mean let's face it not
                        colors contrast better than black and white) and doesn't take away from the overall color scheme of the page. If these social buttons took on their original/native
                        colors then it may take away from the actual color scheme that was put into place on the entire website. Also, each of the social buttons are a great size for the
                        user to be able to click on the correct social plugin to get them to exactly where they want to share this page to which in the end helps out the client and everyone
                        is happy! The last thing that makes this footer stand out is the thinness of the circles that surround the logos of each of the social sites. This almost makes the
                    buttons look like they are illuminating which helps the elements pop out at the user to be noticed.</p>

            <ul>

                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>People who want to see reviews of a company that they are looking at. No one likes to go into spending money on things blind and this appeals to
                        those people who are more than likely already settled into a career and are 28+ years old. </p>
                </li>

                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>This reaches the client goals because it allows their users to see what people have said about their company. The best part about testimonials is
                        that its only good things that are being said about your company. What company doesn't want to show that off? The best part about this and the
                        greatest way this appeals to the client goals is that the design is professional and it makes the testimonials feel believable which is imperative
                        to gaining a users trust. This design also fulfills the user needs because they can clearly see what people have said about this company and it is
                        presented in a trustworthy way which is what a user wants to see before they make decisions. It also helps the user needs because they can clearly
                        see the faces of the people who have said these things which shows the user that people trust this company enough to allow them to show their photo
                        on this website along with what they've said. This composition is geared toward getting the user to trust the client so that the can then begin to
                    generate a profit from a larger customer base which I think it does a great job at doing.</p>

                <li>
                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p> Overall this design is great for both the user and the client. It is laid out in a great way and when it is actually being implemented on the page the
                        elements and the text are just the right size as to not clutter everything and make it clash with other elements. The box shadow was also a great idea to
                        implement on this component due to the fact that the border on each of the boxes are very minute. If the box shadow was not here then the white of the box would
                        blend in too well to the background of the page. As for the colors of this design I think it's fine being in black and white because there isn't
                        much feeling that needs to be portrayed here aside from the feeling of professionalism. I'd also like to add that the round photos are a great touch to this
                        design. If the photos were square it wouldn't have that social connectivity feeling to it which is what makes this design so fluid.</p>

                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>The target audience of this composition is anyone who wants to find out more about this company and what they do. It also appeals to clients who
                        want to allow their user to find out more about their company. The age group of this would mostly appeal to people who are above the age of 20 considering
                    that the page is a landscaping company website which would appeal to homeowners and people who rent</p>

                <li>
                    <h4>Client Goals and User Needs</h4>
                    <p>The client goals are met in this design due to the fact that they have everything they need in this composition to allow their users to view what
                        their company is about. It has a great structure and the design is impeccable allowing 4 different options for users to click on so that the company
                        get every detail of themselves out there into the minds of users. On a side note, this design can be used in more than just a "what we do" section
                        of the page. So, this composition speaks to the client goals in more ways because it is versatile. This also appeals to the user needs  in that they
                        can easily recognize what what they need to click on to get to the correct destination. If this wasn't sample text in this example then the user would
                        be able to click on only the information they want to hear about instead of browsing useless information that they have no interest in searching for
                        what they want to read. Its organized, its simple, and it works well. Because it works so well the users can easily find out details about this company and
                    how they go about caring for the customers lawn which will help the client gain profits from its userbase. </p>

                    <h4>Design Critique</h4>
                    <p>I for one absolutely love this design. Its smooth, its crisp, and its structure is great. Even the colors are perfect in this design because everything
                        contrasts well allowing the user and client to clearly and visibly make out different elements. There is never a space in this composition that you can
                        not clearly see. Even the colors portray the right mood for this such as the blue conveys feelings of calmness, trustworthiness, stability which all relate
                        to this in some shape or form. The green helps show a feeling of freshness, reliability and healthy which all besides healthiness are pretty accurate for the
                        feeling of this page. The icons and buttons are the perfect size and are very well thought out in the design and have great detail. The use of making the
                        buttons square instead of rounded also help with the overall design of this, I'm not sure how to explain it but it just makes the page feel right and I couldn't
                        imagine them being rounded because it just wouldn't convey the right feelings that are already in place here.</p>
